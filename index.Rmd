### About

My name is Chelsey Oppan and I am a second-year Master of Public Health candidate at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. I have a background in health policy and data analysis, with an interest in improving health and access to healthcare for all individuals. When I'm not stressing over school, I enjoying baking new recipes, watching movies, or spending time outdoors.
